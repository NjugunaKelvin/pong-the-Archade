# 🎮 Pong Game  

Relive the classic Pong game with this fun and educational project! Built using Python's **Turtle** module, this game is perfect for beginners and enthusiasts who want to learn Python while enjoying a retro gaming experience.  


## ✨ Features  

- 🕹️ **Interactive Gameplay**: Control two paddles and keep the ball in play.  
- 🎯 **Realistic Collisions**: The ball reacts to walls, paddles, and missed hits dynamically.  
- 🏆 **Score Tracking**: The scoreboard updates live as you compete.  
- 📚 **Learn Python**: Understand how game logic, OOP, and collision detection work through clean, modular code.  


## 📂 Files Overview  

- **`main.py`**: The main game logic.  
- **`paddle.py`**: Defines the `Paddle` class for paddle control.  
- **`ball.py`**: Defines the `Ball` class for ball behavior.  
- **`score.py`**: Defines the `Score` class for scorekeeping.  
- **`.drawio`**: A diagram file (optional, not part of the gameplay).  


## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Classes Breakdown  

### 🏓 `Paddle` (`paddle.py`)  

- **`__init__()`**: Initializes a paddle object.  
- **`right_paddle()`**: Positions the paddle on the right side.  
- **`left_paddle()`**: Positions the paddle on the left side.  
- **`go_up()`**: Moves the paddle upward.  
- **`go_down()`**: Moves the paddle downward.  

### ⚪ `Ball` (`ball.py`)  

- **`__init__()`**: Creates the ball object.  
- **`move()`**: Handles the ball's movement.  
- **`bounce_y()`**: Reverses the ball's vertical direction when it hits a wall.  
- **`bounce_x()`**: Reverses the ball's horizontal direction when it hits a paddle.  
- **`reset_position()`**: Resets the ball to the center when a point is scored.  

### 📝 `Score` (`score.py`)  

- **`__init__()`**: Initializes the scoreboard.  
- **`update_board()`**: Updates the scoreboard display.  
- **`l_point()`**: Adds a point to the left player.  
- **`r_point()`**: Adds a point to the right player.  


## 🎮 How to Play  

1. **Run the Game**: Launch the game by running `main.py`.  
2. **Control the Paddles**:  
   - 🅰️ **Left Paddle**: Use the `W` (up) and `S` (down) keys.  
   - 🔼 **Right Paddle**: Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.  
3. **Game Objective**: Prevent the ball from passing your paddle and try to outscore your opponent!  


## 🧠 How It Works  

The game logic in `main.py` includes:  
- **Ball Movement**: Smooth ball motion controlled by a loop.  
- **Collision Detection**: Handles interactions with paddles and walls.  
- **Scoring System**: Updates the scoreboard when a paddle misses the ball.  

This project demonstrates:  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
- Game mechanics like collision detection and score tracking.  
- Modular code organization.  

## 📖 Sample Code  

Here’s a snippet from the game loop in `main.py`:  

```python  
while game_is_on:
    time.sleep(ball.move_speed)
    screen.update()
    ball.move()

    # Wall collision
    if ball.ycor() > 280 or ball.ycor() < -280:
        ball.bounce_y()

    # Paddle collision
    if ball.distance(right_paddle) < 50 and ball.xcor() > 320 or \
       ball.distance(left_paddle) < 50 and ball.xcor() < -320:
        ball.bounce_x()
        ball.move_speed *= 0.9

    # Right paddle misses
    if ball.xcor() > 380:
        ball.reset_position()
        score.l_point()

    # Left paddle misses
    if ball.xcor() < -380:
        ball.reset_position()
        score.r_point()
```
